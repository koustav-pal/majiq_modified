def rng_seed(seed: int) -> None:
    """Set seed for random number generator pools

    Set seed for random number generator pools. There are two separate rng
    pools in new-majiq, one for nm.beta_mixture, and another for nm.internals.
    This is a helper function that sets the seed for both pools. Note that
    this means that random number generators from these modules could be
    correlated if used in the same session (we offer this convenience function
    because we think that generating LSVCoverage and sampling from beta
    mixtures in the same session is a rare use case).

    Parameters
    ----------
    seed: int
        Integer value used to seed the random number generators

    Resize rng pools to allow n simultaneous threads. There are two separate

    nm.internals. This is a helper function that resizes both pools.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n: int
        The number of random number generators that can be simultaneously
        acquired (should be equal to the number of threads performing random
        number generation)
