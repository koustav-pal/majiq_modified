class SJExperiment(object):
    """Spliced junction and retained intron coverage for the same experiment.

    Junctions and retained introns are defined over contigs, not genes
    (i.e. :class:`ContigIntrons`, :class:`ContigJunctions`, not
    :class:`GeneIntrons`, :class:`GeneJunctions`).
    Coverage assigned to these regions is later mapped to their gene
    equivalents (matching contig and strand; matching coordinates for
    junctions, matching annotated status and overlapping coordinates for
    introns).

    Coverage is obtained over unique bins.
    Bins represent positions at which the start of the feature would intersect
    the aligned read.
    In the case of junctions, there is a single bin for each possible position,
    so the total number of bins/positions is determined by the maximum read
    length.
    For introns, nonzero length increases the total number of possible
    positions.
    In order to treat introns and junctions similarly, MAJIQ groups together
    contiguous positions into the same number of bins as junctions.

    This is represented by:

    - :class:`SJIntronsBins` with intron coverage and assigned regions
      (:attr:`SJExperiment.introns`),
    - :class:`SJJunctionsBins` with junction coverage and assigned regions
      (:attr:`SJExperiment.junctions`).

    introns: SJIntronsBins
    junctions: SJJunctionsBins
